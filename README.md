## Overview

This system implements a 3-level cascade referral program where users earn commissions from trading fees generated by their referred users. The system includes cashback rewards and supports custom commission structures for KOLs.

## Business Logic

- **Fee Distribution**: For each trade fee of $F:
  - Cashback: 10% returned to trader
  - Level 1 Commission: 30% to direct referrer
  - Level 2 Commission: 3% to referrer's referrer
  - Level 3 Commission: 2% to third-level referrer
  - Treasury: 55% remaining

- **Referral Depth**: Limited to 3 levels to prevent infinite chains
- **Commission Tracking**: All earnings tracked by user, level, and source
- **Claim Management**: Users can claim unclaimed commissions

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Backend

The backend of referral system is implemented separately using NodeJS (Fastify). Please visit the [repo](https://github.com/smohamedjavid/nf-backend) for more information.
